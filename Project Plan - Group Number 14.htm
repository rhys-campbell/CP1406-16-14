<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 14</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>,  Rhys Campbell, Cameron Clark, Callum Robertson, Allan Serrurier </p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Concisely state what the goals (purposes) of the website are. Note that the goals must be to improve something in a measurable way. Why is the site needed? How does it benefit the client? Be clear and specific. Good goal statements are only a few sentences and contain no unnecessary information. </p>
<p>With focus on local community and love for the musical arts, the website is to entice the customer to purchase tickets for the next performance. Complementary to this is to influence the customer to sign up for membership and engage in sponsorship of the orchestra. Completion of these goals will result in an increase in revenue for the Barrier Reef Orchestra.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Describe how the success of the site will be evaluated. How do you know that the site does what the client wanted? Measure the goals you stated above. </p>
<p> Simply an increase in ticket sales will determine the success of the primary goal (to increase ticket sales). Furthermore, the second goal targeting membership can be measured by an increase in new memberships. The final goal of sponsorship can be measured by an increase in donations to the Barrier Reef OrchestraBarrier Reef Orchestra, not just inquires.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Describe two things clearly and specifically: 1. the target audience that your site is intended for (be specific;; you can't aim for everyone) 2. how you will intentionally design the site to cater to this group (as distinct from an y other, different ta rget audience) </p>
<p>Currently more elderly audience, website should be catered to their needs. IE accessibility, readable fonts. Resize text button somewhere on page? </p>
<p>Client wants more young people to attend, current number dwindling. </p>
<p>Should also cater for needs of patrons, members, band members, interested parties? &nbsp;(client stories here?) </p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>This section should contain a dot -ï¿½ point list or table of the pages you intend to make and the content to go on each of those pages. Create the flowchart based on this. </p>
<h2>Site Flowchart</h2>
<p>Create a site flowchart to show the hierarchy of pages in the site and their relationships. Each page should be represented by one box . Each line/arrow represents a link . T he order of boxes is the order these links should appear on the site. If you don't have a preferred drawing program for flowcharts, use www.draw.io . Save your flowchart as a PNG and insert the image in your plan file under this headining<br>
