<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 14</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>,  Rhys Campbell, Cameron Clark, Callum Robertson, Allan Serrurier </p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Concisely state what the goals (purposes) of the website are. Note that the goals must be to improve something in a measurable way. Why is the site needed? How does it benefit the client? Be clear and specific. Good goal statements are only a few sentences and contain no unnecessary information. </p>
<p>The goal of the website is to get more people to purchase tickets for performances, sign up for membership and engage in sponsorship of the orchestra.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Describe how the success of the site will be evaluated. How do you know that the site does what the client wanted? Measure the goals you stated above. </p>
<p>Success will be measured by an increase of ticket sales, memberships and donations. If Barrier Reef Orchestra attracts a rise in these statistics, the website will be deemed a success.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Describe two things clearly and specifically: 1. the target audience that your site is intended for (be specific;; you can't aim for everyone) 2. how you will intentionally design the site to cater to this group (as distinct from an y other, different target audience) </p>
<p>The website should be targeted at the potential audience of the Barrier Reef Orchestra. Therefore, the website should be classy and refined, common traits of the orchestra scene. The Barrier Reef Orchestra is interested in attracting more young people to their shows, so the website should be appealing and advertising. However, as the current audience is predominantly older, the website should be simple to use.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>This section should contain a dot -ï¿½ point list or table of the pages you intend to make and the content to go on each of those pages. Create the flowchart based on this. </p>
