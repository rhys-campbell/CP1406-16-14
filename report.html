<h2>PMI</h2>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Some positives that we found was GitHub was very useful for our group to be able to work on the project in different locations and be able to get the updates that other made.
    Use of slack made communicating with each other very simple, It also had real time updates for when something was uploaded to github or upated on trello.
    While everyone in the group had different strengths and weaknesses, we came together well to help each other whenever a hand was needed.
    User testing helped to highlight some of our issues that we werent able to pick up on ourselves.
    Using PHPstorm made it very easy to notice errors we have made as it highlighted the error. By Completing the plan early this we had a clear idea
    on what our goal and layout of the website would be which made everything from then onwards very simple. The website we have created is great,
    the plan and goal has been reflected well on the site.
     </p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Javascript requires more time to be proficient and understand processes which resulted in us Heavil relying on JQuery.
    Our group struggled to use Trello effectively by lodging jobs they were planning on doing and completing, which resulted in some memebers working on the same things
    . We had a few GitHub conflicts which would have been resolved if we communicated better. Also we were requiried to use Gitshell to reselve some conflicts which we
    were unsure how to do so had to get Lachlan to help with. No checkpoints or deadlines were set which resulted in some members not completing tasks
    early enough. Some members did not check on slack often which left them behind for many tasks. </p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> Bootstrap was great for the framework and templates which helped out a lot. Using online validators was very
    useful to nulify mistakes that we may have missed. Hosting on the server made it accessible to test on mobile and other devices.
    Having the client come in to talk to us directly was great to learn more about what they wanted out of the website.</p>
