<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Github was useful for teamwork. Communication through Slack allowed better cohesion. Able to work off of each others strengths. Group came together well - no real issues or arguments, everyone was able to learn from each other. Integration between Github, Slack, and Trello made real time updates very helpful. User testing helped to highlight some of our issues that we didn't catch. PHPStorm highlights errors in coding and valid links. Completing the plan early made sure the website was on goal early. Had a clear idea about the goal from the start. </p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Javascript requires more time to be proficient and understand processes. Heavily relied on JQuery. Trello was not used as well as it should have been. Github conflicts could have been resolved with better communication. Should have set checkpoints or goals for group work. </p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> Bootstrap was great for framework and templates. Validators are helpful for good practice. Identifying the source of a problem was often difficult. Hosting on the server made it accessible to test on mobile and other devices. Having the client come in to talk to us directly was helpful.</p>
