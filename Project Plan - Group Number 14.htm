<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 14</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>,  Rhys Campbell, Cameron Clark, Callum Robertson, Allan Serrurier (late contribution) </p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>With focus on local community and love for the musical arts, the website is to entice the customer to purchase tickets for the next performance. Complementary to this is to influence the customer to sign up for membership and engage in sponsorship of the orchestra. Completion of these goals will result in an increase in revenue for the Barrier Reef Orchestra.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Success will be measured by an specific increase of each; ticket sales for up coming performances, new memberships and new sponsor donations. If the Barrier Reef Orchestra attracts a rise in these statistics, the website will be deemed a success.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>A representative of the Barrier Reef Orchestra has requested the website target young adults. Designing a website for the millennial generation can be difficult, instead the website should focus on a specific type of young customer; who is on the fence about attending.  There will be young customers who visit the webpage who have not been to an orchestra before and may make assumptions about it being not quite for them. Design elements should dispel this notion and instead be inviting. This can be achieved through the use of images of young members of the orchestra, an upbeat modern feel and presenting exciting upcoming events as exciting.</p>
<p>However, as the current audience is predominantly older the website should remain accessible for all ages. This can be achieved with clear fonts, simple design and navigation. A button that increases the size of font would also be useful for those who may have trouble reading the website. </p>
