<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 14</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>,  Rhys Campbell, Cameron Clark, Callum Robertson, Allan Serrurier </p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Concisely state what the goals (purposes) of the website are. Note that the goals must be to improve something in a measurable way. Why is the site needed? How does it benefit the client? Be clear and specific. Good goal statements are only a few sentences and contain no unnecessary information. </p>
<p>With focus on local community and love for the musical arts, the website is to entice the customer to purchase tickets for the next performance. Complementary to this is to influence the customer to sign up for membership and engage in sponsorship of the orchestra. Completion of these goals will result in an increase in revenue for the Barrier Reef Orchestra.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Describe how the success of the site will be evaluated. How do you know that the site does what the client wanted? Measure the goals you stated above. </p>
<p>Success will be measured by an increase of ticket sales, memberships and donations. If Barrier Reef Orchestra attracts a rise in these statistics, the website will be deemed a success.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Describe two things clearly and specifically: 1. the target audience that your site is intended for (be specific;; you can't aim for everyone) 2. how you will intentionally design the site to cater to this group (as distinct from an y other, different target audience) </p>
<p>A representative of the Barrier Reef Orchestra has requested the website target young adults. Designing a website for the millennial generation can be difficult, instead the website should focus on a specific type of young customer; who is on the fence about attending.  There will be young customers who visit the webpage who have not been to an orchestra before and may make assumptions about it being not quite for them. Design elements should dispel this notion and instead be inviting. This can be achieved through the use of images of young members of the orchestra, a crisp theme and effective advertisement of exciting upcoming events.</p>
<p>However, as the current audience is predominantly older the website should remain accessible for all ages. This can be achieved with clear fonts, simple design and navigation. A button that increases the size of font would also be useful for those who may have trouble reading the website. </p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>This section should contain a dot -ï¿½ point list or table of the pages you intend to make and the content to go on each of those pages. Create the flowchart based on this. </p>

<h2>Site Flowchart</h2>
<p>Create a site flowchart to show the hierarchy of pages in the site and their relationships. Each page should be represented by one box . Each line/arrow represents a link . T he order of boxes is the order these links should appear on the site. If you don't have a preferred drawing program for flowcharts, use www.draw.io . Save your flowchart as a PNG and insert the image in your plan file under this headining<br>
