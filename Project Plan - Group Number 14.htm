<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 14</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong>,  Rhys Campbell, Cameron Clark, Callum Robertson, Allan Serrurier </p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Concisely state what the goal s (purpose s ) of the website are . Note that the goals must be to improve something in a measurable way. Why is the site needed? How does it benefit the client? Be clear and specific. Good goal statements are only a few sentences and contain no unnecessary information. </p>
<p>Increase ticket sales. More membership sign ups. More sponsorship.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Describe how the success of the site will be evaluated. How do you know that the site does what the client wanted? Measure the goals you stated above. </p>
<p> Actual increase in ticket sales. More membership sign ups. More sponserships.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Describe two things clearly and specifically: 1. the target audience that your site is intended for (be specific;; you can't aim for everyone) 2. how you will intentionally design the site to cater to this group (as distinct from an y other, different ta rget audience) </p>
<p>Currently more elderly audience, website should be catered to their needs. IE accessablity, readable fonts. Resize text button somewhere on page? </p>
<p>Client wants more young people to attend, current number dwindling. </p>
<p>Should also cater for needs of patrons, members, band members, interested parties? &nbsp;(client stories here?) </p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>This section should contain a dot -­ point list or table of the pages you intend to make and the content to go on each of those pages. Create the flowchart based on this. </p>
<h2>Site Flowchart</h2>
<p>Create a site flowchart to show the hierarchy of pages in the site and their relationships. Each page should be represented by one box . Each line/arrow represents a link . T he order of boxes is the order these links should appear on the site. If you don't have a preferred drawing program for flowcharts, use www.draw.io . Save your flowchart as a PNG and insert the image in your plan file under this headining<br>
